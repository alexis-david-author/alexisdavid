        title: "Daemon",
        content: `
<p>Luka didn’t know where his pain medication was disappearing to. The first time, he thought it was user error. His fatigue penetrated deep into his bones, he very well could have miscalculated. But the numbers kept dropping like dead doves, hunted and shot down, and now he knew he wasn’t fabricating paranoid stories. This was actually happening.</p>
<p>The problem was, Eden didn’t know where the Oxycodone was going either. The question had been tearing at her neurons, ripping off the myelin sheaths and exposing the axons to her all-encompassing confusion.</p>
<p>She had been working on this novel for about eight months now. Of course, her project was unrecognizable from the tale it was last year, but she knew it was for the best. If her initial plot had any more holes it would be a fishing net. It was better this way.</p>
<p>Only, she had run into drywall and all she could do was stare at the cracking paint.</p>
<p>Luka came to her like a friendly apparition, “friendly” describing the way he approached her, not the way he carried himself. One could not at once describe him as friendly and tell the truth.</p>
<p>Luka Cunningham. Age: 22. Tall and lean with eyes that wanted to be black and eyebrows like strips of thick rug. Pretentious, opinionated, sarcastic. Depressed, most notably.</p>
<p>Luka came to her the night she found out her best friend didn’t want to be her girlfriend. Eden vividly remembers the way the wood bit into her feet until they became numb the way she wished her heart could be numb. The moon had dimly lit up the languid clouds just hanging in the air, like they didn’t know it was nighttime.</p>
<p>And through the heavy gray, eyes piercing a pathway, dimly lit and narrow. Eden followed it for a couple minutes until it led her to a blank screen.</p>
<p>It switched on and like an old film, it counted down from five. And like an old film, Eden watched Luka’s life play out. It stopped after a few seconds, and she knew if she didn’t write this down it would slip away from her.</p>
<p>So she barreled through her apartment to find a pen and she wrote everything down on the blank notepad she kept around for situations exactly like this one. Well, not exactly, but inspiration is inspiration even when it has two eyes and a mouth and doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>It continued on like this for months, Luka sliding tidbits of information over to her when he felt like it. And it was hard to be patient, but she tried to fill in the blanks between periods of ingenuity as best she could.</p>
<p>Still her upcoming birthday rose like a menacing shadow high over her head, starting small when it was far away and growing to monstrous proportions as the date drew near. And four months, of course, might not seem near to some, but it had always been her dream to be a published teen author.</p>
<p>Emphasis on teen.</p>
<p>She was almost twenty.</p>
<p>She was almost. Twenty. And she could see her dreams crumbling around her like castle walls that had been hit.</p>
<p>And it was a stupid concept anyway. Some suicidal guy decides not to kill himself and do some reckless shit first. Only every time he checks his stash, he has fewer and fewer pills. And it’s like a contemporary meets mystery meets slice of life, only the whole concept is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Eden just stole things from her own life and her classmates’ lives, and the agonizing part was she thought her idea was so interesting and so novel. She spent hours slaving over it and now the blinds lifted and she could see the uninspired, underdeveloped, piece of shit her book actually was.</p>
<p>Frustration leaked out of her body through small, salty droplets and her closed fist struck the table. The unsteady wood rattled. She cried harder. Her finger hovered over the keyboard and she contemplated deleting the whole thing.</p>
<p>Why did she think she could be an author? Much less a bestselling teen author. She was average and mundane in every way you looked at the word typical. Her purpose was having none.</p>
<p>Luka watched disdainfully as his vessel cried. He supposed he brought this upon himself, selecting some hormonal teenage girl to write his story. It was an impulsive decision, a rushing shift of thoughts, similar to the one he predicted would lead him to end his life.</p>
<p>But his Oxycodone was going missing and someone was in his apartment and he would likely die some way or another relatively soon. And if he must die, he’d certainly prefer to do it himself. And if he couldn’t he would like at the least for his story to be heard.</p>
<p>It was cliche, but people didn’t talk about that black plague that washes over you and makes you crave death enough. It was joked about and said in passing. It was ridiculed and labeled selfish. Maybe if he could get someone to write his experience down for him, put it in a novel, get people to read it…</p>
<p>Maybe he could make a difference. Not in the exact way he would have preferred, but oblivion loomed painstakingly close and beggars couldn’t be choosers.</p>
<p>Luka floated around in this dream state. It was odd, but it was the only existence he knew. He wondered what it would be like to live. He wondered if it would be much different.</p>
<p>Is feeling like he is touching something so different from actually touching it? Giving a friend a hug so different from having a concrete illusion of it? He wondered where the differences would lie, and he desperately wanted to experience it all. He hoped when he died, he would reincarnate as an actual human, but he knew it was more likely that he was one at one point and had reincarnated as a character.</p>
<p>Eden was a wall of despair, and every time she thought she couldn’t possibly get knocked down again, she did. Again. She thought all this trying was purely useless. Months of sleepless nights and cramping fingers. She just wanted to delete the damn file and never look at or think about it again.</p>
<p>How cruel to give birth to something so terrible. How Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Luka knew that if she gave up on her novel, he would never wake again. He would enter a sleep paralysis for the rest of his years. It was a risk of connecting, if your author quits you lose your livelihood. Even if it was just a story to the waking world. Some words sandwiched between more words sandwiched between two covers. All he knew was that he did not stay alive this long just to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Being frozen in the aether, floating. Knowing his family is there but not being able to communicate with them. Seeing Eden for a moment as she said goodbye, then never again. Not that he’d miss that whiny bitch.</p>
<p>He wryly thought about the philosophy of all this. The murder of a possible existence, the suspension of a life. Because when you don’t tell a story, it does die.</p>
<p>Eden rolled her shoulders back and cracked her neck. She would give it another try. No novel comes out great after just one draft. If she wrote a few paragraphs and they weren’t complete garbage, she would continue because that would mean she had potential, and where there was potential there was hope.</p>
<p>She packed her canvas bag and headed out to the cafe half a block down the street. The building had an awful lot of character, the paintings covering every square inch of the walls, the small stage where singer-songwriters and slam poets alike took up space and made life beautiful.</p>
<p>She sat down in front of her laptop. And thought. Writer's block was as real and impenetrable as all the shows made it out to be. So she told herself, “I just have to write something, it doesn’t have to be good. In fact it can be really really bad and it would be okay because at least I’m writing.” So she brushed her fingertips against the keys.</p>
<p>And thought.</p>
<p>Maybe she didn’t have to write the part where they figured out who was taking all those pills in the first place. Maybe she can write some of the parts with him traveling the world spontaneously, or sneaking into a lecture at some prestigious university, or any of the other things on his bucket list.</p>
<p>Luka zipped up his backpack and wrote a quick note to his little brother. “I’ll be back in a few days, Salem. I’m going on a little trip. I’ll bring something cool back for you, I promise.”</p>
<p>The airport was a hub of activity, a spanning spectrum of intensity and lackadaisy.  Luka had a one way ticket to  Milan, bought with the money he had set aside for grad school. He hadn’t anticipated needing it.</p>
<p>The flight was almost twelve hours long, and he spent it reading. He was scribbling an annotation in the margins when the man next to him tapped his shoulder. He raised his eyebrow and in a sharp motion removed the headphones from his ears. “Yes?”</p>
<p>After he had explained that he had to use the bathroom, Luka shuffled into the aisle and put his headphones back on. His skin crawled from the unwanted contact.</p>
<p>He wandered the city when the plane touched down, his backpack hitched upon his back. His mind was five hours ahead of his body and he wondered whether to find a restaurant or a hotel first.</p>
<p>He still could not believe he up and flew to Italy so spontaneously, but the truth is sometimes the little things are not enough to keep you alive. He walked into a coffee shop and ordered in comprehensible Italian. He had been self-studying it for years. When he was younger he always pictured himself traveling the world, being fluent in ten or more languages.</p>
<p>He was practicing Spanish, Korean, Italian, and Russian but still he was far from where he wanted to be. He wasn’t near fluent in anything but Spanish. And he was sure his accent left many things to be desired.</p>
<p>He chewed his croissant and then took a sip of his black coffee. The rush was slowly seeping from his body and he wanted to smash his plate on the ground. Could he not be happy for one day? He was in fucking Italy.</p>
<p>He stood up, disturbed by the melancholy that was washing over him, and decided to walk around some more. He came across shops and statues. And there was a beautiful stone bridge and he didn’t jump from it.</p>
<p>He walked past a man yelling at his son and goosebumps started forming on his arms. He rubbed them away and kept walking.</p>
<p>Eventually he found a hostel and he got a bed for $26 a night for three nights. When he got to his room, he found his bed and lay in it, thinking of next steps. He thought of calling someone but there really wasn’t anyone coming to mind. And that was depressing that nobody cared about him or liked him or wanted him around.</p>
<p>If he gets drunk out of his mind that night, no one needs to comment. Sometimes when he gets drunk he gets powerful and he can do things he can’t do otherwise.</p>
<p>Eden cracked her knuckles. She would finish this story if she had to rip it out of her brain folds. She decided to glean inspiration from what she has written so far. Reread her work and see if anything jumps out at her, some connection she didn’t mean to make, a twist that would fit so perfectly.</p>
<p>There was a wince glued to her face as she read. She anticipated it would be bad and then it was worse. But when she got near the end, the prose grew poetic yet also somehow blunt. She did not remember typing these words, but she must have in some sleep-deprived state.</p>
<p>She checks the page count and there are 372 pages and this is odd because she had left off on 304. But she read and she grew enamored by her tense, tragic prose, and she reached page 345 exactly and saw that Luka had killed himself. And she paused.</p>
<p>Because she hadn’t written that.</p>
<p>She finishes reading the novel and she stares at her screen in shock. “Somehow I didn’t see that one coming.”</p>
<p>And if Luka were still around he would be happy to know that his story got shared.</p>

        title: "Lady of Whispers",
        content: `
<p>The children thought if they approached the whispers they might become intelligible, that their comprehension would be proportional to their proximity. Only they couldn’t figure the source of the hushed noise. It was coming from somewhere down in the darkness.</p>
<p>They exchanged a glance as the sky cried into the Earth’s open jaws, and they drew up to the lips of the mouth in the ground.</p>
<p>They didn’t need words, but they used them regardless. “We have no choice,” he said.<br>“Let’s go,” she replied.<br>She set her foot on the first step of many and began her descent. The stone was apathetic to their small feet. It sat impassively and watched the night unfold. It said to itself they don’t know how little I know.</p>
<p>They walked without words for a quarter of an hour, their steps occasionally lining up with the thunder and making them gods for split seconds. Summoning lightning with their feet and casting it out to the sky.</p>
<p>“Did you hear?” he asked eventually.<br>“Hear what?”<br>“Sable’s house got goosed yesterday.”</p>
<p>The girl drew her eyebrows together and tried to figure out whether she knew what her friend was talking about. Deciding that she didn’t, she asked him to elaborate.</p>
<p>“The goose killer,” he said, bracing his arms in the air, wishing there were handrails. “Each night he breaks into a different person’s home. He always leaves behind a scrap of paper. Scrawled in tiny letters is always ‘duck’ or ‘goose’. It’s simple, you remember that game? Where everyone sits in a circle and one person goes around patting heads saying ‘duck duck goose’? He plays it in the nuanced field of life where the lines are unclear and the only referee is Death himself. Your paper says duck you’re safe. But if you get goose, you better start hightailing it. He gives you a day to run, but invariably a resident of that house shows up dead by the end of the week.”</p>
<p>“Did Sable and they run?”<br>He shrugged. “Didn’t bother to.”<br>She took it in stride. “I wonder who he’ll pick.”</p>
<p>Their steps matched up for a few seconds and to someone listening in, they were one person. They wondered if this might give them the element of surprise should something choose to attack. Their footsteps disjointed and they were two separate entities again.</p>
<p>“Have you been seeing the dolls?” she asked.<br>He shook his head and though she couldn’t see him in the inky darkness, she assumed he did so when he didn’t reply. “It’s a phenomenon. Children across the country are seeing them in their rooms at night. I saw one the other day. It was tall as the ceiling and moved like it was attached to a rail in the ground. All smooth.”<br>“Sounds like an omen,” he commented.<br>“I think so too.”</p>
<p>“Do you think we should head back?”<br>They were many feet below the ground and it smelled like cold earth. They began to wonder if this stairwell was leading them straight to hell.</p>
<p>After a few moments of speechless suspension, another set of footsteps could be heard above them. Slow and heavy like an ambling giant.</p>
<p>The children gasped and closed the gap between them. They clasped hands against the presence so sinister they almost surrendered right then and there for their hopelessness. Its steps were slow but sure, and the children knew it would not stop. Not if the sky crumbled and the Earth started shaking and rising above the debris.</p>
<p>“I think not,” she replied finally to his question of whether to abandon their mission.<br>They plodded on, knowing if they stopped, they were history. Not knowing if they continued whether they would also be history.</p>
<p>The pounding footsteps like dark beatings of an evil heart. They tried to ignore it. It was only natural after all that such beasts would be attracted to the whispering pit below the ground.</p>
<p>“We might be entering the Lady of Whispers’ chamber,” she noted after listening to the tangled murmurs a few moments.<br>“Who is that?”<br>She rolled her neck and sounds like sharp cuts of static leaked out. Her voice aptly dropped. “They say she’s looking for the daughter that was stolen from her. One night she sang her to sleep and the next morning she was gone from the nursery. She raked the whole town with no luck. It was the torment that transformed her into what she is now. Demon of chaos, spirit of darkness.</p>
<p>“When she enters your mind, she tears through it, looking for anything that will bring her closer to her baby. Anything that might help get her back. It’s as if your thoughts are no longer yours. She can hold them in the palm of her hand and squeeze them into disintegration. You go mad, slowly. You hear her quiet rasp in your ear telling you to go to this cave or search this house. People get arrested for breaking and entering, but they can’t help but follow her instructions. She has complete control. If she thinks you will be more useful depressed, she will twist every happy memory, reorganize your thought patterns. If she wants you to be bold, she will pinch your amygdala until it is the size of a beetle’s leg. She can make you anything you don’t want to be.</p>
<p>And when she’s done with you, she inhabits someone else’s mind. And here lies the only way to purge her from your body.”</p>
<p>The boy listened with wide eyes as she grinned wide and maniacally.</p>
<p>“You tell someone her story real quiet, and you open your mouth and you–”</p>
<p>A great squelching ensued. Like someone reaching into a mother’s belly and pulling her unborn from her uterus. The sound like the penetration of the uterus walls. Or like stepping in something altogether disgusting. Something that your feet could soak up and use as an excuse to become evil.</p>
<p>The girl choked and coughed to help the hand shoot through her throat and out her frozen mouth. She felt fingers clutch the sides of her face, using her flesh as leverage to pull itself through her oral cavity. Her jaw snapped and pain hit her like an anchor dropped from the clouds. She screamed and it seemed to lubricate the Lady’s escape.</p>
<p>She crawled from the spot where the girl’s broken jaw lay slack. She crept down her chest and shifted forms. Soon a woman stood before them, ebony hair trailing down her back, teeth tinged with blood red. Clothes in shambles, eyes slit and wild.</p>
<p>In another second she was an undefined mass. The temperature dropped and the boy realized only as he inhaled and coughed around her that his mouth was open in a scream.</p>
<p>And the first thing she whispered to him was: “run!”</p>

  content: `
<p>I traced the solar system pattern on my childhood bed sheets.<br>
“Do you ever feel like you’re in a little space shuttle, drifting? And in the whole universe, there’s no one on your side? You’re just looking down at the Earth and you’re fucking screaming? But it’s into the void.” Fiona asked. “And like…no one understands you? Because you don’t let anybody in. And you push them away instead.” She took a deep breath. “And everyone hates you and you wish you could be different.”</p>
<p>I nodded slowly. “Yeah, I know what you mean. The stars seem so scattered and you’re so far away from everything. And you can’t bring yourself to move in any direction, you’re lost no matter what you do. When you touch your hand to your heart, it’s beating, but you’re not alive. And there’s this wormhole, and through it, you think you can see humanity. And suddenly you’re fine, you’re okay—just the other side of okay.”</p>
<p>She breathed quietly. “Are you just saying that?”<br>
“No, I—I want to let people aboard, but that means they’ll see the real me, no suit, no helmet. They’ll see the nothing behind the front I put up, and maybe I was better off drifting alone.”<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
“I am so much that is not me. And even that is not enough.”<br>
She looked up at the ceiling. “Enough for what?”<br>
I bit my lip. “To mean anything to anybody.”<br>
She twisted her mouth. “Sometimes I don’t think anybody does.”<br>
And my gut sank.</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Rylan,” she said, standing up.<br>
“Goodnight,” I whispered.<br>
“I love you.”<br>
I hated myself for not saying it back.</p>
